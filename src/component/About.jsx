          Welcome to my modeling portfolio. I started modeling in October 2019 and immediately fell in love with meeting talented creatives and helping to bring their ideas to life. My time is primarily spent in New York City, NY; Miami, FL; and Columbus, OH. I am also available to travel to other destinations in the United States and internationally. I have experience in editorial, runway, commercial, and pageantry.
